# Rest-API-Explore
A basic Rest-API web app(Just to get the hang of it) written using NodeJS.

#ToDo:<br>
- write inside project dir "npm install" to install all the dependencies.
- choose the port in port variable.
- write "node index.js" to start the server.
- I recommend insomania software to send get&post requests from the server.


#Note:
- all the changes and inercation with the server stored in the database file.
